**Dreambot is a message analyzer designed to be placed on a Slack channel.**

The bot is constantly storing messages on any slack channel itâ€™s on. When it detects a question, the user will receive a direct message making sure we are categorizing it correctly. If they do not want to receive these messages, they can easily opt out of receiving messages in the future. We want anyone to have access to the data that we collect, so we also developed a frontend that shows various bits of information we have collected.
